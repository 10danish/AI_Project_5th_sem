# Description of the project:
I did this project in 5th sem in which I had to write algorithms to solve any maze and conclude which algorithm was faster.
The maze can be generated randomly through code or created manually in a .txt file.
Specifically I have written the BFS, DFS and UCS algorithms to solve the Maze.
The conclusion was that BFS algorithm is fastest as it explores multiple nodes at a time and thus reaches 
the goal node faster.

# How to Use the Code:
Use cell blocks which have specific headings like BFS, DFS or UCS algorithm.
Each algorithm has a random maze generator function.
In the output you will get the maze and the shortest path (from start to goal) for each algorithm.
The graph of maze size vs running time is also there so as to analyze the algos. 
Just run the code in your jupyter notebook.
